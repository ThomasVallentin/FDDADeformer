# Fast and Deep Deformation Approximation (FDDA) for Autodesk Maya

An implementation of Fast and Deep Deformation Approximation (Bailey 2018) for Autodesk Maya. This project has been developped as the end project for the Deep Learning course at UniversitÃ© Gustave Eiffel (France).

## Dependencies 

This project has been written in python 3.9 and rely on the following libraries :

- numpy
- keras
- jupyter -> Only if you want to train the networks using a Jupyter notebook

which can be installed to Maya using the following command :

```
/path/to/your/maya/install/bin/mayapy -m pip install tensorflow jupyter 
```

## How to use 

The main feature of the project is the FDDADeformer, a deformer that learns and applies the offsets between a hard weighted skinCluster and a complete deformation rig. Each deformer uses several deep learning networks (one for each joint bound to the skinCluster) which needs to be trained on a set of poses.

### Recording the dataset

WIP section
```python
from fdda import recording
 
recorder = recording.Recorder("meshToLearn")
recorder.initialize()
recorder.record(samples=200)
recorder.finalize()

# The mesh name is used as the name of the dataset if no name is passed
recorder.save("/path/to/your/dataset/directory", name="nameOfTheNetwork")
```

### Extra content

The project contains a second plugin "distanceToColor" that takes a mesh and a refMesh as input and sets the vertexColors of the outputMesh based on the distance between the two meshes. This can be useful to detect differences between the approximation and the ground truth deformations.
